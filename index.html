					British food – by Lulu Grimes, Lifestyle Director of BBC Good Food 

					“Baked goods are popular all over the UK. In the Lake District, Cartmel is famous for its sticky toffee pudding and Bakewell for its pudding: a pastry base filled with jam and a layer of almond cake. Cornwall and Devon both serve cream teas with scones, the difference being that the Cornish serve the cream on top of the jam, rather than underneath it.

Curry is now British through and through, with restaurants such as Dishoom in London and Edinburgh serving particularly good Indian food. There’s also cheese, try
